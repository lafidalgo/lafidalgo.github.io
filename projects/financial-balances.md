---

### Achievements

- Developed and deployed a **pipeline for financial data extraction** from clients' balance sheets, utilizing **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)** for accurate data processing.
- Implemented the solution on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Microsoft Azure**, ensuring scalability and cloud integration.
- Automated the extraction, storage, and querying processes to optimize time, reduce costs, and minimize human errors in the analysis of financial balances.
- Integrated the solution into the infrastructure of one of Brazil's leading insurance companies, significantly improving operational efficiency.

### Context

This project focused on extracting **financial information from balance sheets** for a major insurance company in Brazil. By leveraging **OCR** and **LLM**, the system was designed to process unstructured data from documents, extract relevant financial details, and provide accurate insights.

The key components of the solution include:
- **Data Extraction**: Uses **OCR** to extract text from scanned balance sheets.
- **Data Processing**: Processes extracted data with **LLMs** for context-based interpretation and organization.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed on **AWS** and **Microsoft Azure** for reliable and scalable infrastructure.
- **Cost and Time Reduction**: Reduced analysis costs, time, and human errors by automating the data extraction and analysis processes.

### Technologies Used

- **AWS** & **Microsoft Azure**: For cloud hosting and integration.
- **OCR**: To extract textual data from scanned documents.
- **LLM**: For processing and interpreting extracted financial data.
- **Docker**: To containerize the solution for deployment.
- **FastAPI**: For developing microservices that handle data extraction and querying.
