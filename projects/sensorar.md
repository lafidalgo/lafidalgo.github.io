### Achievements

- Secured **4th place** in the 2019 NASA Hackathon (**International Space Apps Challenge**).
- Developed **SensorAr**, an innovative platform to monitor and analyze air quality using **compact sensors** and **crowdsourced data** from delivery personnel.
- Designed a system to generate intuitive air quality surfaces and send alerts about potential environmental risks.

### Context

The NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2019 focused on leveraging **sustainability** and **innovation** using NASA's extensive data collection capabilities. 

As part of a multidisciplinary team, we created **SensorAr**, a solution combining NASA's datasets with real-time data collected via compact air quality sensors. These sensors were integrated into the backpacks of **app delivery workers**, ensuring widespread and dynamic data collection across urban areas.

The collected data was processed to:
- Produce a detailed **air quality map** accessible to the public.
- Provide **real-time alerts** on potential environmental hazards.

This project showcased a creative intersection of **technology**, **environmental monitoring**, and **citizen participation**, illustrating how crowd-sourced data can enhance public awareness and safety.

### Technologies Used

- **Compact sensors**: For real-time air quality monitoring.
- **Data integration**: Merged NASA's datasets with urban sensor data.
- **Platform development**: Built to process, visualize, and interpret collected data.
- **Crowdsourcing**: Leveraged app delivery workers to ensure broad data coverage.
