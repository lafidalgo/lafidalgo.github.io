### Achievements

- Developed and deployed a pipeline leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)** to extract critical information from public procurement documents.
- Implemented the solution on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for scalability and performance.
- Streamlined the analysis process to enhance decision-making in public procurement.
- Designed a robust architecture enabling efficient text extraction, storage, and querying.

### Context

This project aimed to streamline the analysis and decision-making process for public procurement documents. By employing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)**, the solution effectively extracts and contextualizes information from unstructured text.

The pipeline consists of the following key components:
- **Text Extraction**: Processes unstructured text from public procurement documents for analysis.
- **Information Retrieval**: Utilizes **RAG** to identify and extract relevant data points.
- **Scalability**: Deployed on **GCP**, ensuring high availability and performance for large-scale processing.

### Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For scalable and reliable deployment.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: To enhance the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval.
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: For intelligent text processing and querying.
